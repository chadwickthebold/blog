The first thing you should always, always check for is a typo. 'onlick=...' is not equivalent to 'onclick=...'. 
Also, it's important to keep a clear record of changes between pushing/pulling/patching. It's easy to loose track of
changes when you're just trying to throw code at a problem hoping it will fix itself. Clear, careful notes are invaluable
in tracking progress and recording successful changes.

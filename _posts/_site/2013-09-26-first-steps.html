<p>Well, here I am. Fresh out of college, 3 months into a new job, the greenest of the green&#8230;</p>

<p><img alt='What I wake up to every day' src='/blog/assets/noidea.jpg' /></p>

<p>I graduated in May from Bucknell University with a degree in Computer Engineering. Being a member of the second graduating class of that major, I naturally had no idea how to leverage my skills into a career. So&#8230; here I am as a UI developer! The majority of my education has revolved around computer science in one way or another. Computers have fascinated me since I was a kid. I remember getting my first issue of Computer Gaming World from my father back in the mid 90s. I was enthralled by the ads for Homeworld, the review of Sim City, and demos for games like Close Combat II. Fast forward through an adolencence of learning BASIC, Java, sketching out game ideas with friends, and 4 years of college, and here I am today.</p>

<p>I started my job as a UI developer in June. I thought I&#8217;d be starting as an enterprise Java developer, and was somewhat surprised to show up the first day and get placed on the UI dev team. It&#8217;s been a very interesting 3 months. Going from 0 to full throtle in web development has been quite the ride. The first few weeks I would come home and pour over the codebase for our product, attempting to piece togeter my understanding of a modern enterprise web application. Every day I face a set of new challenges, so it&#8217;s still quite an exciting time!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s part of the reason I&#8217;m starting this blog. This, along with my personal landing page hosted at tylerchadwick.com are my attempts to continue my learning process. It&#8217;s so easy to come home at the end of a long day, crack a beer and while away the hours watching Law and Order and browsing HN. I&#8217;m challenging myself to comment on any tech trends/programming ideas/new concepts or challenges that I may face. I spent the last few months telling myself I&#8217;d start tomorrow, or next week, or the following weekend. I&#8217;m finally realizing that it&#8217;s better to be first to market than to be perfect on the first try. This blog might be unpolished, my site might be broken - hell, for two weeks tylerchadwick.com wasn&#8217;t even resolving at all! I&#8217;m trying to get things up as I&#8217;m able to put them together, and worry about presentation and polish as a secondary effort.</p>

<p>This was the perfect month to do it, too. A good goal always benefits from the correct motivation. The Bucknell Homecoming weekend - Oct. 25 - 27 - provides such a motivation. I want my site to be up, my blog to be live, and to get a few demos of functioning software I&#8217;ve written published somewhere on the web. As a stretch goal, I&#8217;m hoping to throw together a quick project to demonstrate that my computer engineering degree wasn&#8217;t entirely mis-focused. Well, let&#8217;s get started!</p>
